# REVISED Ultimate Race Day Plan - Based on Actual Research & Route Analysis

## My Apology & Revised Approach

You're absolutely right - I need to do better research. I've now:
1. ✅ Extracted the FULL route from KML (831 points, 27.41 miles)
2. ✅ Calculated exact mile markers (0-26.2) with precise coordinates
3. ✅ Researched actual Charlotte Marathon spectator spots from runcharlotte.com
4. ✅ Found actual business locations and matched them to the route
5. ✅ Identified spots ON the route near good amenities (not just at mile markers)

## Key Finding: Not Just Coffee South End

**Not Just Coffee - South End (2000 South Blvd)** is closest to **Mile 11.5** on the route - you were right! This is a perfect spot.

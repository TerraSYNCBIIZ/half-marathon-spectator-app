# OPTIMAL FINAL RACE DAY PLAN - Efficiency, Comfort & Maximum Support

## My Logical Analysis & Recommendation

After deep analysis considering **efficiency, travel, comfort, enjoyment, and supporting Rachel best**, here's the optimal plan:

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED PLAN: Mile 22 (Near Finish)

**Why This is Best:**
1. ✅ **Efficiency**: Easy travel - only 6 min drive from Mile 20
2. ✅ **Comfort**: Less stress, more time to enjoy each spot
3. ✅ **Support**: Final push support at Mile 22 (critical moment!)
4. ✅ **Enjoyment**: Close to finish = easy transition, can grab food/coffee
5. ✅ **No problematic drives**: Eliminates the long cross-city drive to NoDa

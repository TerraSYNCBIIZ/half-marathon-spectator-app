## 2. ROUTE GEOGRAPHY & PATH ANALYSIS

### Actual Route Path (from mile markers):

```
Mile 0:  Uptown (35.223, -80.847) - START
         ↓ Southeast
Mile 2:  (35.214, -80.829) - Fourth/Hawthorne area
         ↓ Continue Southeast
Mile 6:  (35.184, -80.831) - Myers Park / Queens Road
         ↓ Loop back north
Mile 11: (35.219, -80.852) - South End area
         ↓ Continue looping
Mile 17: (35.241, -80.812) - NoDa (NORTHEAST)
         ↓ Loop back southwest
Mile 20: (35.220, -80.810) - Between NoDa and Uptown
         ↓ Back to Uptown
Mile 26.2: (35.229, -80.847) - FINISH
```

**Key Insight:** The route makes a large loop - goes southeast, then northeast to NoDa, then back southwest to finish. This is important for spectator travel planning.

## 3. TRAVEL DISTANCES & TIMES

### Straight-Line vs. Actual Driving Distances

| From → To | Straight-Line | Route Distance | Estimated Drive Time | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Start → Mile 2.1 | 1.30 mi | 2.10 mi | **5-8 min** OR **20 min walk** | ⚠️ Very close - walking might be better |
| Mile 2.1 → Mile 6.0 | 2.02 mi | 3.90 mi | **11-14 min** | Queens Road closed - use Park/Providence |
| Mile 6.0 → Mile 11.5 | 2.53 mi | 5.50 mi | **13-16 min** | South Blvd may have closures |
| Mile 11.5 → Mile 17.0 | 3.19 mi | 5.50 mi | **15-20 min** | ⚠️ LONGEST DRIVE - cross-city |
| Mile 17.0 → Mile 20.0 | 1.44 mi | 3.00 mi | **9-12 min** | The Plaza may have closures |
| Mile 20.0 → Finish | 2.15 mi | 6.20 mi | **11-14 min** | Uptown closures - park early |

**Critical Finding:** Mile 11.5 → Mile 17.0 is the longest and most challenging drive (South End to NoDa, cross-city). With road closures, this could take 20+ minutes.

## 4. ROAD CLOSURE IMPACT

### Major Roads That Will Be Closed:

1. **South Tryon St** (Uptown) - Start/Finish area
2. **Queens Road West** - Mile 6 area
3. **East Boulevard** - Dilworth area
4. **South Boulevard** - South End (Mile 11.5 area)
5. **North Davidson St** - NoDa (Mile 17 area)
6. **The Plaza / Central Avenue** - Mile 20 area

### Travel Strategy for Each Segment:

**Start → Mile 2.1:**
- ✅ **WALKING RECOMMENDED** - Only 1.3 miles, avoids all road closures
- Alternative: Drive via 4th St / Hawthorne Ln (avoid Tryon St)

**Mile 2.1 → Mile 6.0:**
- Drive via **Park Road** or **Providence Road** (parallel to closed Queens Road)
- Arrive 15 minutes early for parking

**Mile 6.0 → Mile 11.5:**
- Drive via **Park Road → South Boulevard**
- ⚠️ South Boulevard may have closures - arrive early

**Mile 11.5 → Mile 17.0:**
- ⚠️ **MOST CHALLENGING** - Cross-city drive
- Route: South Blvd → Independence Blvd → North Davidson St
- **Recommendation:** Leave immediately after seeing Rachel at Mile 11.5
- Allow **20 minutes** for this drive (not 12-15)

**Mile 17.0 → Mile 20.0:**
- Drive via **North Davidson → The Plaza** (route will be on The Plaza)
- Use parallel streets if The Plaza is closed

**Mile 20.0 → Finish:**
- Drive via **Park Road → Trade St → Tryon St area**
- ⚠️ **PARK EARLY** - Uptown will have major closures
- Consider parking 0.5 miles away and walking

## 5. TIMING ANALYSIS

### Runner Timeline (10 min/mile pace):

| Time | Mile | Location | Spectator Arrival Needed |
|------|------|----------|-------------------------|
| 7:20 AM | 0 | Start | 6:45 AM (already there) |
| 7:41 AM | 2.1 | Fourth/Hawthorne | 7:35 AM (walk from start) |
| 8:20 AM | 6.0 | Queens Road | 8:05 AM (11-14 min drive) |
| 9:15 AM | 11.5 | South End | 9:00 AM (13-16 min drive) |
| 9:50 AM | 17.0 | NoDa | 9:30 AM (15-20 min drive) ⚠️ |
| 10:33 AM | 20.0 | The Wall | 10:20 AM (9-12 min drive) |
| 10:57 AM | 26.2 | Finish | 10:40 AM (11-14 min drive) |

**Critical Timing Issue:** 
- Rachel passes Mile 11.5 at **9:15 AM**
- Need to arrive at Mile 17 by **9:30 AM** (15 minutes later)
- Drive time is **15-20 minutes**
- **RISK:** Might miss Rachel at Mile 17 if drive takes longer than expected!

**Recommendation:** 
- Option 1: Skip Mile 17, go straight to Mile 20
- Option 2: Leave Mile 11.5 immediately (don't wait for coffee)
- Option 3: Use Mile 11 instead of 11.5 (gives more time)

---

## 6. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Current Plan (5 spots)
- **Risk:** Tight timing between Mile 11.5 and Mile 17
- **Mitigation:** Leave immediately after Mile 11.5, skip coffee there

### Option B: Use Mile 11 Instead of 11.5
- **Benefit:** Gives 5 more minutes for travel to Mile 17
- **Trade-off:** Not Just Coffee is slightly further (0.807 vs 0.588 miles)

### Option C: Skip Mile 17, Add Spot Between 20-26
- **Benefit:** Eliminates longest cross-city drive
- **Trade-off:** Lose NoDa experience

### Option D: Reduce to 4 Spots
- Start, Mile 6, Mile 11.5, Mile 20, Finish
- **Benefit:** More relaxed timing, less stress
- **Trade-off:** Fewer viewing opportunities

---

## 7. FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ **RECOMMENDED PLAN:**

1. **Start** (0.0) - Arrive 6:45 AM
2. **Mile 2.1** - **WALK** from start (20 min) - Arrive 7:35 AM
3. **Mile 6.0** - Drive via Park Road - Arrive 8:05 AM
4. **Mile 11.5** - Drive via Park/South Blvd - Arrive 9:00 AM
   - ⚠️ **LEAVE IMMEDIATELY** after seeing Rachel (9:15 AM)
5. **Mile 17.0** - Drive cross-city - Arrive 9:30 AM (tight!)
6. **Mile 20.0** - Drive via parallel streets - Arrive 10:20 AM
7. **Finish** - Drive, park early, walk - Arrive 10:40 AM

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL ADJUSTMENTS:**

1. **Use EXACT coordinates** (see Section 1)
2. **Walk Start → Mile 2.1** (avoid road closures)
3. **Allow 20 minutes** for Mile 11.5 → Mile 17 drive
4. **Leave Mile 11.5 immediately** - no coffee break there
5. **Park early** for finish (0.5 miles away, walk in)

## 8. QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify exact coordinates are used
2. ✅ Update travel times to be realistic
3. ✅ Add road closure considerations
4. ⚠️ Resolve Mile 11 vs 11.5 question
5. ⚠️ Confirm if Mile 17 is worth the challenging drive
